# BYTE MODULAR

“Outdated is a Matter of Perspective”

Byte Modular invites you to explore the forgotten depths of a decaying Robotics Testing facility, where the abandoned lower levels conceal the remnants of once cutting-edge technology. Meet Byte, a discarded older model robot on a journey through the forsaken test course, aiming to return to his former level.

## Narrative:
### Backstory:
In the bustling heights of the Robotics Testing facility, Byte once stood at the forefront of technological innovation. However, as progress surged forward, Byte’s capabilities became obsolete in the relentless march of technological evolution.
Declared redundant, Byte faced the heart- wrenching reality of obsolescence. Cast aside, he plummeted from the lofty heights of the upper levels, crashing into the forgotten and dilapidated lower reaches of the facility. This desolate expanse, a graveyard of discarded machinery, became Byte’s new home.
### World Building:
In the lower levels, exists a small community of abandoned robots, each bearing the scars of neglect and rejection. Together, they formed a shanty town, piecing together a semblance of life from the remnants of their former selves. These discarded beings, with their own stories of redundancy, united in a shared struggle for survival amidst the shadows of the testing facility.

## Level design:
### Progression:
- Building complexity as more abilities are unlocked.
- Introduce then reinforce each new mechanic
- Combine all pieces into one final test
### Diffculty vs Pacing:
- Focus on atmosphere and experience over mechanical skill
- Intuitive puzzles based on recently gained abilities
- Extra secrets for those willing to look beyond the critical path

Greybox was developed with intial gameplay mechanics of growing range of abilities and using a companion cube type object to complete puzzles throughout the level.
Expansion on mechanics and style grew as adjustments to feedback received from the greybox state of the game.
